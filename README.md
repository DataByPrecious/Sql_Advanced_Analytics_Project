# SQL-Advanced-Portfolio-Project

## 📘 Overview
Welcome to **SQL Advanced Analytics Project** repository
This project demonstrates how to use **SQL** to perform in-depth analysis on a relational dataset containing information about **products**, **customers**, and **sales dataset**. The goal is to extract actionable insights using advanced SQL techniques and effective data exploration.

---

## 🗃️ Dataset Structure
The project is based on three core tables:
- **products** – includes product IDs, names, and categories.
- **customers** – includes customer IDs, demographics, and region info.
- **sales** – includes transactional data such as product ID, customer ID, quantity, price, and sales data.

---

## 🔧 Key SQL Techniques Used
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using SELECT, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions
- **Subqueries** (inline and correlated) for filtering and data isolation
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** for organizing complex query logic
- **Window Functions** like `LAG()` for time-based comparison and trend analysis
- **CASE WHEN** statements for conditional logic and custom grouping

## 📊 Sample Insights
- **Change-Over-time-analysis**
- **Cumulative-Analysis**
- **Performance-Analysis**
- **Proportional-Analysis**
- **Customer Report**: Gathers essential fields such as names, ages and transaction details
- Segments, aggregates customer level metrics into total orders, total sales, total productsand calculates valuable KPIs
  
- **Product Report**: This report consolidates key product metrics and behaviours 
- Segments product by revenue to identify High-Performer, Mid-Range, or Low-Performer
- Aggregates product-level metrics
- Calculates valuable KPIs such as recency(months since last sale), Average order revenue and average monthly revenue
